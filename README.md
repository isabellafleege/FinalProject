# FinalProject
Final project for Matlab class
To use the program type guiFinalProject() into the command window. A figure will pop up with my GUI. To use the GUI, write a string of numbers into the x and y values edit box. To seperate one value from the other, place a space between them. This should look like 1 2 3 4 5 for the x values and 1 2 3 4 5 for the y values. The strings should be the same length and contain only numbers or an error message will pop up. Choose which color and type the data should be displayed in, the default is red circles but can be blue asterisks or green dashes. The push button can be pushed at this point and the plot will display these coordinates but if one wishes they can customize the title, x and y labels of the plot by putting in any string they choose in the edit boxes next to the plot. After clicking plot they will apear on the graph. To delete all inputs and go back to the default plot, click the reset button.
